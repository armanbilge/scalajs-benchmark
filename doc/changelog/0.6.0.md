# 0.6.0

* Scala.JS 1.0 support

  We cross-build to retain support of Scala.JS 0.6.x. This will continue until the first upstream dependency drops support for 0.6.x.

* New result format: "JMH JSON"

  This output can be saved and used by JMH-compatible tools like:

  * [jmh-visualizer](https://github.com/jzillmann/jmh-visualizer)
  * [benchdb](https://github.com/lightbend/benchdb)

  What's really cool about this is that you can commit your JMH JSON results to version control and then
  compare multiple results using [jmh-visualizer](https://github.com/jzillmann/jmh-visualizer),
  making it a good way to track the performance of your Scala.JS over time.

* Change how benchmarking works and how results are calculated.

  We actually work the same way JMH does now with warmup and real iterations, and calculate error margins the same way using
  T-Distributions. Not only does this provide more meaningful data when viewing results as JMH JSON, but the benchmark results
  are more accurate.

* Add a "Save" button to text results so that you can save results as a txt/csv/json

* Add a "Copy to clipboard" button to text results

* Format numbers according to locale (where appropriate)

  Eg. English speakers will continue to see 12,345.567, where as Germans will now see 12.345,567

* Show ETA before and during benchmark execution

* Add an "All" checkbox above the benchmark checkboxes

* Rename "Text" to "JMH Text" as that's what it's really emulating

* Upgrade deps
  * Scala.JS 0.6.33 / 1.0.1
  * React 16.13.1
  * ScalaCSS 0.6.1
  * scalajs-react 1.7.0
